# Support and Instructions

Basic use:

1) Connect to the WiFi connection provided by your WiFi ELM327 Device.
2) Turn vehicle ignition on.
3) Start App.

Troubleshooting:

* The ELM327 device must be WiFi, NOT Bluetooth.
* The Vehicle Ignition must be ON. The vehicle can be running (not recommended), but it won't work if it's off.
* The Vehicle must be running a Eurodyne tune compatible with MQB Adjustible Features.
* Check that you are actually connected to the ELM327 and that your device did not try to be helpful by reconnecting to a default network.
* Some ELM327s are counterfeit and bad. I have no way to detect these. Your mileage may vary.
